# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

## Overview:
As a seasoned Data Analyst, I've conducted a range of impactful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects, with a particular focus on the "Supermart Grocery Sales EDA" and the "Titanic Dataset EDA." These two projects serve as prime examples of my ability to extract actionable insights and drive data-driven decision-making, showcasing my expertise in working with various libraries in Python such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

## Project Highlights:
### Supermart Grocery Sales EDA (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn):
* Analyzed extensive sales data, uncovering critical insights into customer behavior and trends.
* Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
* Informed strategic decisions that led to substantial revenue growth for the Supermart.

### Titanic Dataset EDA (Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn):
* Conducted a comprehensive exploration of the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics and survival patterns.
* Leveraged Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-Learn for statistical analysis.
* Unearthed valuable insights into factors influencing survival rates, contributing to a deeper understanding of historical events.

## Impact:
### These showcased EDA projects exemplify my proficiency in Python and its libraries. Through rigorous analysis and visualization, I have consistently transformed complex data into actionable strategies, driving value and innovation. As a Data Analyst, I am well-equipped to contribute data-driven excellence and insights to any prospective role.
